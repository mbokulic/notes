# levels
A level is set using @level={number} at the beginning of the file. You could also do that for each section, but I think that might be too chaotic.

For now, I plan on using these levels:

**keyword levels**
1. only keywords and/or links
2. level one + some definitions and organization (one level of headers max)

**note levels**
3. definitions and text, not organized into chunks
4. organized chunks
