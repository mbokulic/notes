 - challenge 2: accountability mirror
 - ch3: what is uncomfortable for you? Do that. (for me, presenting in front of data scientists)
 -ch5: visualize your goal
 - ch6: write your accomplishements, then stretch yourself next time (intellectually it's harder, but reading X books in a week/month makes sense)

Don't compare yourself to your peers.

Don't specialize: every human is capable of every experience and every thought

Don't desire or encourage getting compliments. Your ego gets bloated and is easier to shoot down with criticism.

rich, happy, healthy

a calm mind is essential for critical thinking

There is no linear output. You were not meant to work 9-5

I need a good network since one day I'll work on my own terms. (I don't think I'm that bad at creating that)

an issue with basic income: people can vote themselves money

test of any good system: build it then hand it over to your enemies

All problems of today are problems of abundance: disconnect from society every once in a while. 

Meditation is the art of doing nothing. It is also a tool for processing old emotions which get piled up in you (that was my perception!!). And one day you get to "inbox zero" and all you think about is what happened yesterday. It is like self therapy: you are your own therapy. Meditation should literally be nothing, it is just witnessing. Concentrating on your breath is just a way of getting there. If you try to do nothing and let your mind roam it will be harder. And he says "60 days, one hour a day" (close to my experience).

search for peace... you can always convert peace to happiness (happiness is peace in motion). You cannot get peace by solving your problems

Desire is a contract: I won't be happy until I get it
Don't have too many desires. Pick one, or a few. You need to be calm to be effective. Low stress.

We live in an age of leverage. You can influence millions by a few lines of code. Therefore the impact of good decision making is insanely big.

Intellectual work is like athletic performance. Train, sprint, rest. Rethink staying at work the same every day!!

You won't gat wealth by selling your time. 

Learn to work for yourself. Everyone will work for themselves soon

Whenever I start a project: don't lose time by not being willing to push your ideas forward. Fail fast (cringy but true here)

A good system is the one you'd be fine handing over to your enemies. Examples of bad systems: censorship, blanket immigration policies (eg by nationality)

Today's problems are problems of abundance. If you want to be effective you need to remove things (calories, information, access to technology, entertainmentâ€¦)

Yup, he agrees. Get rich, obtain freedom by living below your means, pursue your interests. That's the road to happiness

I just had a thought: if I could work on the future of humanity, I wouldn't care about death or trivialities. How do I get there? Is skills even the way to go?

Peace of mind. Now, not in retirement

Damn! Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for tomorrow. When today is complete. How can you get there?
save money so you can afford your lifestyle with your passive income
reduce your lifestyle (become a monk)
do what you love, so money is not an issue

If you're unique you have no competition. The way to get out of work is to be authentic.

Working for things is a trap. Don't get what you can afford, but what you want/need.

Stop updating your peers. Ie, being envious

When you're thinking you have a lot of gaps in your thought: write, then you have to fill your gaps. If you memorize everything, it's a sign that you do not understand things. If you know it, you can derive the knowledge anytime

If there was a single answer to "what is the meaning of life", we wouldn't be free. We would be robots workings towards that. (We are robots in some ways... eg our desire for food and sex)

# forecasting vs explanations
Yeah, forecasting seems to be easier since you have a clear goalpost: precision. Same goes for predicting (ie, without the time component). And it feels like modeling for explanation is harder since you do not have this goalpost.

BUT: when you are predicting, you want to extrapolate to things you haven't seen. *Things you haven't seen.* There is an inherent problem of generalization here. I'm thinking that prediction / forecasting is easier for a practitioner, but harder for the decision maker.

And ultimately, even modeling for explanation should inform decisions (in business settings). Ultimately, both are tough.

# @ME
A passion of mine? Finding your peace with too much technology and screaming around you. How about if we could become our own recommenders, tagging / noting down what happens around us and then using that data to come up with recommendations. Living alongside technology, but not being at its whim.

solving the wrong problem

Draw flow diagrams in order to recognize where your system could fail. Algorithm is just one of the elements. 

 * Eg, does your a/b testing work? Test the system with an a/a.
 * have a good baseline (eg random order on Netflix)
 * the solution might not use an algorithm: recommend the next episode

Redefine the problem: the algorithm only knows of the search space you put into it

 * eg solving a food distribution problem: try to get beans from A to B when another kind of food would be sufficient. It's nutrients that matter,  not particular food

good ideas come not in work-work mode, but in work-play mode (*and a company with strict time, place and mode of work discourages it*)
