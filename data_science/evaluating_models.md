@bkngHamedRazavi pick the right evaluation metric for classification models as

- they might change when the ratio of positive to negative classes changes
- they can be insensitive to your actual business costs

Best if you can use the metric as early as possible. Ideally when training the model, but at least when tuning the hyperparameters.
