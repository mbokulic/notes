# R stuff

tidyverse is

 - dplyr  => data manipulation (aggregation, transformation, selecting cols...)
 - tidyr  => wide to long data and the reverse (similar to reshape2)
 - readr  => reading text data (replaces read.csv, etc and data.table::fread)
 - purrr  => functional programming (replacess apply family)
 - tibble => replacement to data.frame
