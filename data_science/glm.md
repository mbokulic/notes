_These are notes from the Booking training_

In GLM we can predict a function of y instead of y. (That's the `T(y)` term in the general function). Because of this we can apply different error terms, not just the normal errors.

Use AIC relative difference (check the code for GLM, session 3) to compare two models. It will tell you how many times more likely one model is compared to the other.
