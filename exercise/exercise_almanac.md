From here, you can drop your hips to the floor, focusing on driving the ball into your trap and the border of your scapula.

Move your arm: across the floor toward your head (externally rotated shoulder), toward your legs (internally rotated shoulder), to your lower back. You can also rotate your upper body away from the shoulder you’re mobilizing to get more pressure. You can also perform it against a wall / doorway for less pressure and more options to move your arm.

*instructions*: Place a ball on your lower back, just above your pelvis. Focus on keeping your midline engaged to avoid breaking into overextension. If you’re mobilizing your left side, cross your left foot over your right leg. This will take up the soft tissue slack in your low back. Slowly shift your hips toward your left. The goal is to roll back and forth, pressure waving across the tissues of your lower back and upper glute. Do this feet on the ground, or feet propped up on (more intense, spine neutral.

You can lengthen the tissues by extending your bottom arm overhead.

As you breathe out, relax your weight over the ball and let it sink deeper into your abdomen. begin, lie over the ball, positioning it between your hipbone and rib cage, to the outside of your belly button. Add movement to the mobilization by sliding your knee to your hips. You can also move your leg from side to side or pressure wave by twisting your upper body over the ball. For the targeted gut smash use a lacrosse ball and lean over a stool or table. Floss by bringing your knee up.
