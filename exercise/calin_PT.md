# 3d: back

## stretches

 - old: deep upper chest, like a chest fly
 - old: lats holding something solid

**upper traps**
Hold a cable in one hand, low. Shrug your shoulder towards your face, keep head forward and legs spread to be stable. When releasing the tension lean head downward in the direction opposite of the cable. For extra stretch also look up in the direction of the cable. You should feel a deep stretch in the traps.

## activation exercises

**shoulder rotation**
Stand and hold a cable slightly behind you. Your arm should point upward. Now turn your arm and shoulder forward and try to bring your arm between your shoulder blades _without pulling downward_. You will feel this in your anterior delt, very strange feeling.

**shoulder retraction**
Hold a cable in your right hand, right knee on the floor, left leg in lunge position. Extend arm fully, even rotating your trunk a bit. For flexion, pull cable backwards as far as you can while keeping your shoulder depressed and your traps relaxed. Keep your hips tucked (ie, posterior tilt) and chest up. You should feel a very deep contraction of the lats (strongest contraction I felt).

**pulldown for mid traps**
Start with shoulders elevated, pull down with the scapula. You should feel a strong flex between the scapula.

## exercises

 - pulldown with isolated lats and mid back: start with shoulders elevated, pull down first with the scapula. Then pull with your elbows down until the bar is at your nose. You should fill it between your scapula and the lats
 - pullups: pull yourself up completely vertically. Arms and elbows wide (elbows around 90 degrees at top), elbows going down when you're lifting. This is hard and will activate the lats as they are isolated
 - horizontal row: back as horizontal as possible, arms wide, pronated grip. Pull the bar towards your chest, it's almost an opposite of the chest press. You should feel it in the mid back and especially in the lower traps. To feel the traps expand your chest and "puff it out". I did 20kg (just the bar)
 - row with back at around 45 degrees: supinated grip, pull the bar towards your stomach. The shoulders should be protracted and down, "everything should be pulling backwards". You should feel a deep flex in your lats (I did), similar to the one in the shoulder retraction exercise.

# 1st: shoulders

## stretches
**deep upper chest**
lying on bench, legs up, lower back touching the bench. Light weights in each arm, spread arms like you're doing a chest fly. Arms straight, thumbs point downwards when you go down. When at bottom you will feel a deep stretch. Take a deep breath, this will expand your chest but also be heavy on the core

**lats**
Grasp something solid, like a barbell in a rack. Left leg below hip, right leg far back, you're hunched. After you get the right leg as far back as possible, put it closer to the left. You will feel a deep stretch in the lats. Lean to the right and inhale. I felt a really strange and deep stretch in the lats, like I was tearing them apart. Especially at the bottom insertion.

**serratus and shoulder**
Place a rubber band on the bar above you and put your elbow inside it. Take a few small steps forward so you stretch your arm towards the back. You should feel a stretch in the serratus, though I didn't feel much. It felt more like a core exercise for me.

**something connecting neck and shoulded blade**
Take a weight, cca 20kg, in one arm. Lean your head to one side, ear towards the shoulder and turn the hand outwards as you do that, palms facing forward. Keep hand next to your leg, maybe a bit back. You will feel a funny stretch. Now look slightly upwards and towards that arm, while keeping the neck bent.
