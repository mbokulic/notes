# SVG viewport vs viewBox
Viewport is the size of the SVG set by the width and height attributes. Viewbox is the part of the SVG you want to display inside the viewport. You can use the viewport to stretch the SVG. Typicially you would set the viewBox to the actual size of the SVG.

The preserveAspectRatio attribute defines how to stretch and translate the viewBox of the SVG. It has many possible options, better check them out on the net.
