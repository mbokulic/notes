# stuff to learn

## API Layer
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
[GraphQL](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/so-whats-this-graphql-thing-i-keep-hearing-about-baf4d36c20cf)

## static site generator
[Gatsby works with React](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)

## lodash
A better underscore.js2

## babel
Despite the fragmented environment in which JavaScript runs, it's nice to be able to use new language features. Thus, tools such as Babel will transform your shiny, standardized JavaScript into a version that's compatible with older platforms. This process is called transpiling. It's not much different from compiling. By using a tool like Babel, you don't need to worry as much about the headaches of whether or not a given browser will support the JavaScript feature you're using.

##  learn functional programming
That will teach you how to think like a programmer. Great language is clojure. 

#  web dev from scratch
https://medium.com/@sgarcia.dev/my-journey-to-becoming-a-web-developer-from-scratch-without-a-cs-degree-2-years-later-and-what-i-4a7fd2ff5503#.nht8ut17u
 - very practical and to the point
 - "I think my biggest mistake was not mastering the basics before moving on to libraries and frameworks"
 - "people very often recognize and value clean code writers. You’ll find that by writing clean code your coworkers and friends will enjoy working with you even more"
 - I’d heavily advise myself against learning jQuery altogether until I’ve learned how to do things without it. You might not need JQuery site

he does not recommend Pluralsight, they value quantity over quality. But Team Treehouse is good.
